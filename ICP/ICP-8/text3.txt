Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid's left knee showed no structural damage after undergoing an MRI on Saturday, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne.

He's dealing with a bone bruise, which is expected to sideline him for between two and three weeks, per Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic.
